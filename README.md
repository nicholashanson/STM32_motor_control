## Description

Motor control project using TDD ( Unity ) with the goal of integrating it into a turntable system.

UART is set up for integration with QEMU.

## Design Goals

## üöÄ Project Development Goals

A modern embedded development workflow prioritizing testability, modularity, and speed. This project follows best practices to keep hardware concerns isolated and core logic clean.

---

### üß© 1. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

**Objective:**  
Design clean, minimal interfaces to decouple hardware details from application logic.

**Why it matters:**  
By abstracting hardware, we make core logic portable, testable, and reusable across platforms.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Define HAL interfaces (e.g. `pwm_interface.h`, `uart_interface.h`)
- [ ] Replace direct calls to `HAL_*` / `LL_*` with abstracted methods
- [ ] Ensure core algorithms rely only on interfaces, not hardware

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Dependency Injection

**Objective:**  
Inject hardware interfaces or function pointers instead of hardcoding dependencies.

**Why it matters:**  
Makes it easy to swap real hardware with mocks or stubs for testing and simulation.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Refactor modules to receive hardware accessors via parameters
- [ ] Remove hardcoded peripheral calls from business logic
- [ ] Provide constructor/init-style functions that accept interface pointers

### üß™ 3. Strategic Use of Test Doubles

**Objective:**  
Create mocks, stubs, and fakes to simulate hardware behavior for unit tests.

**Why it matters:**  
Reduces reliance on physical hardware and enables testing of edge cases with precision.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up a unit test framework (e.g. Unity + Ceedling)
- [ ] Implement mocks for I2C, UART, ADC, timers, etc.
- [ ] Simulate fault conditions, timing delays, and sensor inputs in tests

---

### üíª 4. Host-First Testing Strategy

**Objective:**  
Run the majority of tests natively on the development machine or QEMU.

**Why it matters:**  
Faster test execution, easier CI integration, and quicker development cycles.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Compile tests for host platform (e.g. using GCC or QEMU)
- [ ] Use target hardware only for final integration and signal validation
- [ ] Automate test runs in CI using native builds

## Development Workflow

1. **Test-Harness Synchronization**: Any changes made by code-regeneration in STM32 CubeMX are reflected in the
   test-harness, ensuring the test environment is identical to the production environment.
2. **UnityTest**: All production code is first tested in UnityTest, a unit-test framework well suited to embedded developement.
3. **Qemu**: Qemu provides an on-host test environment through hardware emulation. It has in-built support for STM32 emulation through several development boards. This allows us
   to test early on-host, giving a tight development loop perfect for TDD.
4. **Proteus**: Proteus provides emulation for STM32 MCUs, like Qemu, but also models pins, allowing us to run firmware and do signal analysis. This lets us treat the MCU as a black-box with clear outputs that we can test before integration with peripherals.
